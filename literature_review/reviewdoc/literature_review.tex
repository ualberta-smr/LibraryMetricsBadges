\section{Introduction}
% Give idea of the topic of the literature review, patterns + theme
% Work in Progress. This will be edited a lot.
Third-party software libraries and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offer a way for developers
to use existing features and funuctionalities to build their projects without having to re-invent the wheel.
There are many libraries to use for different programming languages whether it is open source 
or hosted elsewhere. Although having this much freedom for deciding on what libraries to use is flexible,
it is also conflicting to figure out which one is best for your project. It is difficult to choose because
there are a variety of factors involved such as functionality and developer support. 
In this review, we look at several diferent articles to help analyze various properties of libraries and 
determine a helpful comparison between them.

\section{Body}
% Not sure how to format articles. Could start with one article per paragraph.

% That would take to long. Format by theme? 
% Recommenders, Badges, API Comparisons by Metrics, Usage, etc.

\newpage
\section{Conclusion}
% Summarize key points
