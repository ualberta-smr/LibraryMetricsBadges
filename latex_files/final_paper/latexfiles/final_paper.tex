\section{Introduction}
% How do developers select libraries
% Iinstead of using websites, and online sources
% we look to create badges that can be shown on the spot to users
% to help them seee metrics and pick the best library
asdsd
% Make it a story

% dont explicity reccomend libraries. Allow develoeprs to make their
% own judgement to select librarie. Another quanittiative tool
% to help compare b/w 

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Library Selection Goals}
% This work focused on explicity recomending libraries versus. 
% helping users pick which ones to use. My work is related to X while it 
% differentiates itself from Y

% Library COmparison WEbsite (same method to solve similar problem)
% Library Recommender (Opiner differe methods but similar problem)
% Analogical Libraries (differnt method , same problem)
\subsection{Metrics}
\subsubsection{Quality Assurance}
% Security
% Build
% Test code coverage

\subsubsection{Community Support}
% Stack Overflow

\subsubsection{Repository General Information}
% Pull Requests
% Releases
% Issue Stats
% Commits 

\subsection{Summary}

\section{Background}

\subsection{Badges}
% Trockman's work
% Look at what make's a good badge, not looking at how it can help developers choose libaries
\subsection{Online Badge Services}
% Shields io

\section{Badge Implementation}
\subsection{Overarching Structure of Scripts}
% Insert diagram of how we made our badges

\subsection{Security}
% Talk about limited Fernando's technique and describe why using spotbugs
\subsection{Last Discussed on Stack Overflow}
% Techqique borrowed
\subsection{Issue Response Time}
% Techqique borrowed
\subsection{Contributor Pull Request Merge Rate}
% PR Shopify article
\subsection{Release Frequency}
% Techqique borrowed

\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Open Source Evaluation}
% Shields.io Open source contributions
% Choose SO badge b/c it has the least amount of data to process and gives us a good
% start to see if prototyping thsi works 
\subsection{Future Work Evaluation}
% If I had 4 more months, how would I evaluate this work.
% Have badges hosted on Shields and figure how how many people are using them for popularity?
% Survey insights to why they are suing those specific badges

\section{Threats to Validity and Limitations}
\subsection{Internal Validity}

\subsection{External Validity}
% <10% comntibnutor rate doesn't capture misclassifies some to be contribtuor when in reality are maintainers

\subsection{Limitations}
% Database caching
% Security only works with Java Libraries and requires seperate update 
% SCripts can only be used locally and need to rerun ngrok everytime


\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
% Future work
% Host Scripts openly using something like heroku or now.js
% Improve Error handling to make sure client knows any bad http codes
% make front end application to display these metrics to get detailed info, visualizations of metrics
% being used where and number of people suing them in line graph
